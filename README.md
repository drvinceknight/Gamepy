# Gamepy: some python code for game theory....

This contains some code for a growing number of game theoretical subjects. At the moment there are 4 pieces of code:

- Shap.py (a library to calculate the shapley value for a cooperative game)
- Abm.py (a library to simulate a population of strategies in an evolutionary context)
- lrs_nash.py (a library that solves a normal form game using the [lrs](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html) library)
- Gale_Shapley.py (a library to solve matching games using the extended gale shapley algorithm)

# Website

I've posted some user docs and videos about some of the game theory on [drvinceknight.github.com/Gamepy](http://drvinceknight.github.com/Gamepy/).
